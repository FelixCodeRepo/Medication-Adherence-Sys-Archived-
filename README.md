# Medication Adherence System (Archived 2020)
Here is my major work in this project for Software Engineering CSCI 3130 (2020 Winter):
- Login interface design & validation with firebase
-	The interface provides a list of medications with a simple search bar
-	Update the medication record for each user with Firebase

This course project is suspended in the early 3rd phase (Total is 4) due to Covid-19 when it hit the NS in March.
